## Description

CelestialData is a decentralized application built on the Solana blockchain, designed to create and manage a database of celestial body features. The platform allows users to store detailed information about celestial bodies, such as their name, type (e.g., star, planet, asteroid), and composition, including the specific contents and their respective percentages. 
Users can input and update this information seamlessly. The application also features an optional validation tool to ensure that the composition percentages entered for a celestial body are complete and accurate. By leveraging Solana's high-speed and low-cost infrastructure, CelestialData provides a secure, scalable, and transparent way to manage and share astronomical data, catering to researchers, educators, and enthusiasts.

## Vision

CelestialData aims to revolutionize how scientists and researchers store and access data about celestial bodies. By providing a decentralized, efficient, and transparent platform, it simplifies the process of recording and verifying critical information about stars, planets, and other cosmic entities. Our vision is to empower scientists with a reliable tool to organize and share their data seamlessly, fostering collaboration and innovation in the field of astronomy. By leveraging blockchain technology, CelestialData ensures that valuable astronomical information is securely preserved and accessible, driving advancements in space exploration and our understanding of the universe.
